A chill, unsettling desert wind blows grains of sand past your face as you awaken.
Your eyes slowly crack open to see you’re inside of a decomposing, rusty structure. 
It appears as if it’s been around for a thousand years, but constantly maintained and repaired 
with slightly less old, but still just as rusty, patches of scrap metal. 
You’ve regained more awareness, and see that a large crack in the hull of this metallic beast is 
the source of desert wind and sand, but behind you the metallic structure groans, and the 
darkness of its hallways entices you.

1. Leave the barge.
2. Explore the barge.
You chose: 1. Leave the barge.
The howl of the desert entrances your deranged mind, and you slowly wander out from the
barge into the sandy wasteland. You wander for what seems like days, weeks, perhaps even 
months, but you know it isn’t as it seems, the roar of the sandstorms whispers into your crazed 
ears. Eventually you collapse near the edge of a blackened, oily looking swamp. After a few 
hours of much needed rest, you continue wandering into the depths of the swamp. Along you 
way, you spot a small, rotting hut in the distance.

1. Continue wandering deeper into the swamp.
2. Investigate the hut.
You chose: 2. Investigate the hut.
It’s been days since you’ve eaten or drank clean water, the hut seems like the place to stop. As 
you trudge your way over to it, you hear the clink of some tin cans in the distance. A hobbled, 
old woman wearily opens the door to the hut, casting an uneasy stare at you. You explain that 
you mean no harm, and she lets you in. “This swamp isn’t for the living, you need to leave. But 
before you go, I will give you some coin and grub in exchange for a little bit ‘o labor.”

1. Leave the swamp.
2. Help the old witch out.
You chose: 1. Leave the swamp.
You don’t need to waste time helping a poor old woman out, so you move on. It might be worth it 
to heed her warning about the swamp, so you head back towards the desert, there’s bound to 
be something else, or just more sand. The lack of food and water severely cripple your 
movement, and you feel as if you might die. The swamp may be able to meet your needs,
but something’s not right about it, and you’re unsure if dehydration or poison will grant your
demise.

1. Forage from the swamp.
2. Move on.
You chose: 1. Forage from the swamp.
You cave into drinking the swamp’s mystery liquid, and eating some slimy moss 
growing on the sides of trees. It fills you a little, but then you pass out again. You can almost 
taste the desert heat as you near the swamp’s edge, and you see the deserted ruins of a town.
The filth of the swamp seems to have swallowed up the town entirely, something is not as it seems. A weathered and moss infested sign holds several wooden arrow-shaped signs that 
point to various towns and cities, most point deeper into the swamp. One points outward, into 
the desert, and reads Trent, city of the Gonti. It’s description says it’s only a day and half away, 
so you wander back into the desert. 
The heat feels worse, and the swamp flora starts to boil your insides. You fall to the ground in 
agony, regretting not working for some real food. Your vision starts to blur, and in the distance, 
you see a small skiff surfing above the sands, it’s the last thing you ever see.

YOU DIED

You chose: 2. Help the old witch out.
Some food and water sound very promising to the well-being of your current lifespan, so you 
decide to help the witch out. You split moldy-looking wood, patch holes in the hut’s roof, and 
repair a few fence posts. The witch graciously gives you much more than you deserve, but 
seems happy to have some help, and company. She bids you on your way, and points in the 
direction of the nearest settlement.
You wander on, and can almost taste the desert heat as you near the swamp’s edge, and see 
the deserted ruins of a town. The filth of the swamp seems to have swallowed up the town 
entirely, something is not as it seems. A weathered and moss infested sign holds several

You decide the swamp doesn’t offer any more life than death itself does. You wander on , and can almost taste the desert heat as you near the swamp’s edge, and you see the deserted ruins 
of a town. The filth of the swamp seems to have swallowed up the town entirely, something is 
not as it seems. A weathered and moss infested sign holds several wooden arrow-shaped signs 
that point to various towns and cities, most point deeper into the swamp. One points outward, 
into the desert, and reads Trent, city of the Gonti. The center of this town has a well, and its 
water greatly aids your dying body. Upon scrounging some more, you find some moldy bread 
and tainted meat, but it still suffices. You also find some leftover coin in a few house, whoever  
left here, left fast. Turning back towards the town’s sign, the description for Trent says it’s only a 
day and half away, so you wander back into the desert…

The harsh desert sun blinds you for a moment, but as your eyes adjust, you see a small skiff 
buzzing and whirring about in the sunset. You start to wave them down, and the skiff 
immediately makes a beeline for you. It comes to a sudden stop, and then one its operators 
hops out, making a small crater in the sand. “Not many enter that swamp, and much less come 
out, where are you heading?”. You tell him you may be headed for Trent, and he says; “Huh, we 
come from Trent, and no one’s recently headed out this way. You must be from somewhere 
else… C’mon we’ve got someone who’ll want to meet ya”. The other skippers practically pull 
you onto the ship, and it zooms off towards Trent.

A few hours later, the city pops into your field of vision. The city is enclosed with massive, 
ancient red stone walls. A central spire sticks out from the center like the stem of an 
upside-down mushroom made of stone. The rest of the city seems to bulge out from the city 
walls, hardly being contained. The skiff passes through a military checkpoint to go into the city. 
You sort of gather that this group has some type of clearance, and isn’t just a group of 
scavengers. As you near the central spire of Trent, one scavengers radios something to an 
unknown person, and a massive stone door lifts up, uncovering a hidden air bay in the higher 
parts of the spire.

An elevator guides your descent to the main chamber, and when you arrive…

Press Enter to continue....

Several armored sentinels stand guard around the chamber, with a small throne in the center. A 
man, almost made of smoke, wearing a metallic mask that seems to flicker to life sits upon it, 
clothed in ancient, threadbear robes. He immediately turns to you, and grabs your attention with 
the glimmering mask. “Ah, it seems my scouts have brought me something, but is it of value?”. 
The skipper that seems to be the leader of the group, steps forward, “We found this one near 
the settlement of Gerso, wandering in the desert”. The man of smoke, turns to you, but it’s 
difficult to tell if he’s staring at you with the glowing eyes and mask. “Ah Gerso, we were 
preparing to accept more of their people, surely you passed by it in the desert?” he asks.

You explain that you wandered through a battered and plague-ridden settlement that looked like 
it’d been long abandoned, and give a general description of it. “We last contacted Gerso two 
weeks ago… this plague is spreading faster than we thought.” the smoky man says, “it may be 
time to fight the plague harder and stronger”. He turns back to you, “You must be a little 
confused. My name is Gonti, Minister of Trent, and a plague is spreading, swallowing 
settlements whole, and we do not have the manpower to research and defend against it, as 
constant raider attacks keep our militia quite busy.”

Gonti seems to think, the smoke twists and curls in the air, and then he turns to you. “Let me 
see what knowledge you have, after all, you have survived the plague swamps.” A black orb 
raises from the ground and the smoke seeping from the man’s visage seems to be drawn 
towards it. As the smoke wraps itself around the orb, you feel your mind start to twist and 
turn, it feels as if the smoke is enveloping your head. After a few minutes, the man stops. “Ah, I 
see, you have much familiarity with the plague, more than you know.” “You’ve forgotten your 
memories since the barge crash, but you come from a city to the South that was also destroyed 
by the plague, and your barge carried some of the last survivors.”

“I think I may have use for you…

Press Enter to continue....

“You lack experience in the ways of this world, but you still have much use. I am in need of bay 
captains to protect and guard the air-ports of Trent from raiders and marauders. This would give 
me more manpower to send towards combating the plague. The pay would be quite well, and 
you would have a chance to protect our city from those who harmed yours.”

“Do you accept?”

1. Yes.
2. No.
You chose: 1. Yes.
You start off as the captain of one of Trent’s several air bays, and defend it from numerous 
raider attacks and attempts to sneak in. Gonti and the rest of Trent’s government notice the  
good work you put in, and you’re promoted from bay captain to marshall of all Trent’s 
surrounding airways. Gonti’s warning pays off, and you successfully deter a massive raider 
assault. The city still takes casualties, as the war rages on for several years, but the raiders are 
severely weakened, and dissolve into the tumbling sands of the desert. 
Years later, a plague from the South creeps towards Trent. The city has the resources to fend it 
off, as less manpower is devoted to driving off raiders, but it still affects the city. 
Around the same time your first child leaves on their own, the plague is deterred. Trent remains 
standing tall, a scarred city, but the survivors prosper.
