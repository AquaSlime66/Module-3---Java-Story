### Fill Out the Checklist
Complete the following checklist to make sure you completed all parts of the module.  Mark your response with **Yes** or **No**.  If the answer is **No** then additionally describe what was preventing you from completing this step.

|Question                                                                                         |Your Response|Comments|
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-|-|
|Did you implement the entire set of unique requirements as described in the Module Description document in I-Learn? |Yes* | |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code in your software and include useful comments?                              |Yes | |
|Did you use the correct README.md template from the Module Description document in I-Learn?                         | Yes| |
|Did you completely populate the README.md template?                                                                 | Yes| |
|Did you create the video, publish it on YouTube, and reference it in the README.md file?                            | Yes| |
|Did you publish the code with the README.md (in the top-level folder) into a public GitHub repository?              | Yes| |

* I did complete my unqiue requirements, but the money/inventory system isn't really used. It's there, works fine, and is interacted with at different points in the story, but it's not as grand as I described it to be.

### Did you complete a Stretch Challenge 
The stretch challenge I chose was to modify your program to read/write to a file. My program saves the user's created story to a .txt file as they go along.


### Record your time
How many hours did you spend on this module and the team project this Sprint?  
*Include all time including planning, researching, implementation, troubleshooting, documentation, video production, and publishing.*

|              |Hours|
|------------------|-|
|Individual Module | 14 hrs, 30 mins|
|Team Project      | ~6|

### Retrospective
- **What learning strategies worked well in this module?**
  Scheduling everything out (the hours, location, etc.) proved to be much more helpful than I originally thought it would be. It was nice being able to plan around it, and giving myself an extra hour or so was nice.
- __What strategies (or lack of strategy) did not work well?__
  Something I can improve on is my use of tutorials. For past modules I heavily used tutorials, while still adding features and code that were my own unique creations. This project wasn't too crazy, and I only relied on ChatGPT for basic syntax and formatting. Java is really not that different from C# (at least, for what I did), and so this strategy worked for the project. I still feel like more/better tutorials would have really polished off the program.
- __How can you improve in the next module?__
  This project definitely had detailed aspirations... I wouldn't say they were lofty, I can accomplish everything I set to do, I just decided to minimize one aspect (the buying system). The issue I can improve on is setting realisitc goals without adding too much extra flair. A text-based game that saves to a file meets the requirements. I'm not saying I won't go above and beyond the requirements, I love challenging myself, but this semester I do not have adequate time to dedicate enough of myself.
